# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a complete authentication system for the mobile application, including a login screen with username/password input, token-based authentication, secure token storage, and protected dashboard access. The system ensures that users must authenticate before accessing the dashboard and maintains their session securely.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log in with my username and password, so that I can access the dashboard securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display a login screen with username and password input fields
2. WHEN the user enters valid credentials and submits THEN the system SHALL call the login API endpoint
3. WHEN the login API returns a successful response THEN the system SHALL receive an access token
4. WHEN the user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
5. WHEN the login form is submitted with empty fields THEN the system SHALL display validation errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want my login session to persist, so that I don't have to log in every time I open the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL store the access token securely in local storage
2. WHEN the user reopens the app AND has a valid token THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to the dashboard
3. WHEN the stored token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login screen
4. WHEN the user logs out THEN the system SHALL remove the token from storage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to be protected, so that unauthorized users cannot access it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user tries to access the dashboard without a valid token THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login screen
2. WHEN a user has a valid token THEN the system SHALL allow access to the dashboard
3. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL check for a valid token and route accordingly
4. WHEN the token is present but invalid THEN the system SHALL clear it and redirect to login

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a smooth navigation experience after login, so that I can quickly access the dashboard features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the dashboard screen
2. WHEN the user is already logged in and opens the app THEN the system SHALL navigate directly to the dashboard
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions without flickering
4. WHEN the user accesses a protected route without authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect to login and remember the intended destination
