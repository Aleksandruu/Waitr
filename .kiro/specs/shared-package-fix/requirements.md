# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The shared package setup for the Waitr monorepo needs to be completed and fixed to enable proper code sharing between the mobile app, web app, and backend. Currently, there are several configuration issues preventing the apps from building and properly importing shared types and utilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the shared package to build correctly and be consumable by all applications, so that I can share types, utilities, and assets across the entire codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the shared package is built THEN it SHALL generate proper TypeScript declaration files and JavaScript output
2. WHEN any application imports from the shared package THEN it SHALL resolve the imports without TypeScript errors
3. WHEN the shared package is updated THEN all consuming applications SHALL be able to rebuild successfully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript project references configured, so that the monorepo builds efficiently with proper dependency tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the backend THEN it SHALL properly reference the shared package as a TypeScript project reference
2. WHEN building the web app THEN it SHALL properly resolve shared package imports
3. WHEN building the mobile app THEN it SHALL properly resolve shared package imports
4. WHEN the shared package changes THEN dependent projects SHALL rebuild only when necessary

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent module resolution across all applications, so that imports work the same way in development and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing from shared package THEN the import paths SHALL be consistent across web, mobile, and backend
2. WHEN using shared types THEN they SHALL be properly typed in all consuming applications
3. WHEN accessing shared assets THEN the paths SHALL resolve correctly in all environments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be streamlined, so that I can build all applications without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running build commands THEN the shared package SHALL build before dependent applications
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN all applications SHALL properly link to the shared package
3. WHEN developing locally THEN changes to shared package SHALL be reflected in consuming applications
