- [x] 2. Fix shared package TypeScript configuration

  - Update tsconfig.json to use proper composite project settings
  - Configure correct output directory and module resolution
  - Fix include/exclude patterns for source files
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_

- [x] 3. Update shared package.json configuration

  - Fix export mappings to point to correct built files
  - Configure peerDependencies for future Redux and React dependencies
  - Update build scripts for proper compilation
  - Configure package as publishable with correct entry points
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1_

- [x] 4. Fix base TypeScript configuration

  - Update tsconfig.base.json path mappings to point to built output
  - Fix project references to use correct paths
  - Ensure consistent module resolution across all projects
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.1_

- [x] 5. Update backend TypeScript configuration

  - Fix project reference path to shared package
  - Update import paths to use correct shared package structure
  - Ensure proper module resolution for CommonJS
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 6. Update web app configuration for shared package

  - Verify Vite configuration works with shared package
  - Test import resolution in development and build modes
  - Update any hardcoded import paths if needed
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.2_

- [x] 7. Update mobile app configuration for shared package

  - Verify React Native Metro bundler works with shared package
  - Test import resolution in development and build modes
  - Update any hardcoded import paths if needed
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.2_

- [x] 8. Build and test shared package

  - Run build command and verify output structure
  - Test that all exports are properly generated
  - Verify TypeScript declaration files are correct
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [x] 9. Test backend application build

  - Run backend build command and verify it succeeds
  - Test that shared package imports resolve correctly
  - Verify all existing shared imports still work
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2_

- [x] 10. Test web application build

  - Run web app build command and verify it succeeds
  - Test that shared package imports resolve correctly in Vite
  - Verify development server works with shared package
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.3_

- [x] 11. Test mobile application build

  - Run mobile app build/start command and verify it succeeds

  - Verify development server works with shared package
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.3_

- [x] 12. Add build dependency management
  - Update package.json scripts to ensure shared package builds first
  - Add workspace-level build scripts if needed
  - Test full monorepo build process
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2_
- [x] 13. Prepare shared package for future extensibility
  - Set up export structure that can easily accommodate Redux stores
